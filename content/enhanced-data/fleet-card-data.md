## Fleet Card Support


A fleet card is a method of payment that allows fleet managers to:

*  [ ] Enable their drivers to pay for fuel without having to use cash, checks, or a personal credit card
*  [ ] Control purchasing by driver and limit transactions by frequency, amount, or day
*  [ ] See purchase details for transactions with line-item details, like the grade of fuel and number of gallons
*  [ ] Monitor, manage, and control costs associated with the vehicles in the fleet

You can support Fleet Cards by supplying additional information in the **fleetData** option under the **enhancedData** object.
