## SDK Integration

This page would contain information specific to using one of the programming language specific SDKs (Software Development Kits)

Merchants would use this approach if they want build integrations to our Payment APIs **using** our SDKs.

Fundamentally, they will need to:

* select a programming language
* download the available language-specific sdk
<br/>
* follow the instructions in the Step by Step Tutorial to setup the project and add the sdk
<br/>
* The can build a request in the API Explorer and then **cut and paste** the generated **working** code directly into their programming project and run it.
